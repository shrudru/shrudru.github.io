The third phase of Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP-III) is fully integrated with the Twelfth Five-year Plan objectives for <br>
Technical Education as a key component for improving the quality of Engineering Education in existing institutions with a special consideration for Low <br>
Income States and Special Category States (SCS) and support to strengthen few affiliated technical universities to improve their policy, academic and<br>
 management practices.<br><br> 

TEQIP III will support approximately 200 engineering education institutes across India to produce higher quality and more employable engineers.<br>
 The focus of the project is to strengthen engineering education in India’s low-income, hill states and states of the North East. The Project will be implemented <br>
as a 'Central Sector Scheme' with total project outlay of Rs. 3,600 crore. However, the project would be initiated with a cost of Rs. 2,660 crore, with the possibility<br>
 of additional financing of Rs. 940 crore at later stage. Out of the Rs.2,660 crore, the Central share will be Rs.1,330 crore and external assistance from the<br>
 World Bank through International Development Association (IDA) Credit of Rs. 1,330 crore. The project is implemented with the facility of Direct Funds Transfer<br>
 to the accounts of beneficiary institutes. The project started in the current year and will be coterminous with Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) in 2020.<br><br>

The major outcomes of the project are:<br><br>

(i)             Better academic standards, through accreditation, filling up faculty positions, training faculty in better teaching methods, improved research outputs in institution in Focus States/UTs.<br>

(ii)            Better administration of the institutions with improved financial/academic autonomy.<br>

(iii)           Better systems for assessment of Student Learning, higher transition rates.<br>
